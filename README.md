# Miranum Connect Basic Template

Simplified, beginner-friendly GitHub template for initiating new projects with Miranum. This template is focused on the key features of Miranum Connect - Worker creation, Message correlation, and Process start.

## Features

This template provides the following features:

- **Worker Creation**: Implement the `doSomething` method in the `MyWorker` class to perform actions on received commands.
- **Message Correlation**: Implement the `correlateMessage` method in the `MyMessageCorrelation` class to correlate messages with process instances.
- **Process Start**: Implement the `startProcess` method in the `MyProcessStart` class to initiate a process instance.

## Prerequisites

Before using this template, make sure you have a running instance of Camunda Platform 7 set up.
This template relies on Camunda Platform 7 for process execution and integration.
You could easily change to a different process engine by adding the corresponding Miranum Connect adapter dependencies.

## Getting Started

To use this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Update the necessary resources to match the name and description of your project:
    - [README](./README.md) (title, description)
    - [POM](./pom.xml) (artifact name, id, description)
    - [Worker](src/main/java/io/miragon/example/MyWorker.java) (rename, implement)
    - [Message Correlation](src/main/java/io/miragon/example/MyMessageCorrelation.java) (rename, implement)
    - [Process Start](src/main/java/io/miragon/example/MyProcessStart.java) (rename, implement)
3. Ensure that you have a running instance of Camunda Platform 7.
4. Build the project using the following command:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

5. Run the project by executing the generated JAR file.
6. Interact with the project's features, such as creating workers, correlating messages, and starting processes.
